## Test of the Close-fit hypothesis

```{r}
close_fit(df = 5, n = 373)
```

Interpretation: if this model actually does not have close fit in the population, then the estimated probability that we can reject this incorrect model is 31.7%.

## Test of the Not-close-fit hypothesis

```{r}
not_close_fit(df = 5, n = 373)
```

Interpretation: if this model actually has close fit in the population, then the estimated probability that we can detect this correct model is 22.9%.
