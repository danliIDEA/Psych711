Structural Equation Modeling (2013)
===============================================================================



10 Commandments of SEM (Thompson, 2000)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. No small samples.
2. Analyze covariance, not correlation matrices.
3. Simpler models are better.
4. Verify distributional assumptions (multivariate normality)
5. Consider theoretical and practical significance, not just statistical significance.
6. Report multiple fit statistics.
7. Use two-step modeling for structural regression models. (Test the measurement model then the structural model.)
8. Consider theoretically plausible alternative models.
9. Respecify rationally. (Test the respecified model on new or split-halves data.)
10. Acknowledge equivalent models.
