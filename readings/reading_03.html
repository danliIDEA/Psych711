<h1>Exercises about Rex Kline&#39;s book (for Tue., Sept. 24)</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>A. Read pages 51&ndash;72 very carefully. Be prepared to explain to a novice what the topics below mean and why they are particularly important in SEM. For each of the topics you should be able to say two or three sentences without looking at your notes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Positive definiteness of matrices (causes, indicators of nonpositive definiteness)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Collinearity (between a pair of variables and between a variable and two or more others)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Outliers (univariate outliers, multivariate outliers)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Missing data (ignorable, systematic, MAR, MCAR, available case methods, mean substitution, regression-based imputation, model-based imputation)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Normality (univariate, multivariate) and transformations</strong></p>

<p><strong>Linearity and homoscedasticity</strong></p>

<p><strong>Relative variances</strong></p>

<p><strong>Reliability and validity</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>B. Make a table that looks like the trouble shooting guide of the last dishwasher you bought. In the left column are the potential problems, in the middle column are the ways to diagnose the problems, and in the right column are ways to solve the problems (½ to 1 page max.). </p>

<p>C. Once you are done with A. and B., take a recent data set of yours, select 5 to 10 variables that are important to your hypotheses, and do some data screening. Among the selected variables there should be at most one experimental manipulation with two levels. Selecting only measured variables is fine, too. Go through the table you made in B. Check whether each problem is present in your variables, i.e., check whether your covariance matrix is positive definite, check whether there is a collinearity problem in your data (e.g., by computing the variance inflation factor for each of the variables), check whether there are outliers (e.g., by computing Mahalanobis distance for each observation), and so forth. Summarize your data screening (what you did and what you found) in ½ to 1 page. If you want you can put additional information (R script, box plots, etc.) in an appendix, but your summary should be informative by itself (I must be able to understand it without looking in the appendix). </p>

<p>D. Do exercise 5 on page 74 (preferably in R but other software is fine too). Write a one-sentence conclusion. </p>

<p>Create a single word document with your trouble shooting table (B.), the summary of your data screening (C.), the normal probability plot plus conclusion (D.), and an appendix (optional) and send me the document on Tuesday, by 11:30 am. <em>Note: You should do these exercises by yourself but feel free to consult with others and to ask them for help. If you give help to others, help them find the solution themselves rather than giving them the solution.</em></p>
